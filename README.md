This project is a Selenium-based web automation script that automates the process of booking a football field in Dubai. 
It navigates the booking website, fills out the required form fields (such as date, time, and location), and submits the request on behalf of the user. 
Mainly created out of necessity as the desired football field that the program was designed to book is a highly desired field due to its location.
This is mainly a simple yet efficient program that lacks certain refinements that would be expected.
